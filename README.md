This cash register function returns 3 statuses, if the drawer has money and the cash given is able to cover the price of the product the function will return a status of 'open' and the amount of change that is extra divided perfectly with coins and dollar bills.
If the drawer has money but the cash given is not able to cover the price the function will return a status of 'isufficient funds' with no change.
If the price is covered but the drawer is empty after the change is given the register will return a status of 'closed'
Eventually I'll come back to this when I'm bored and add a status of 'change drawer' if the drawer is not able to give back the change required for the purchase.
