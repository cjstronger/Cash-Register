This function is currently under work but will work as a cash register that takes a price, cash to give back and cash in register.
The end goal is to log/return the ammount of cash given back in a group to easily read which bills and coins were handed over.
Also to include a setting to log 'insufficient funds' when the ammount of cash given is not greater than or equal to the price.
